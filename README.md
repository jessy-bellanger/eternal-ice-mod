This small mod adds some new ice blocks for players who want to have ice blocks that never melt.
 
The main problem with the original ice block is that it melts. I mean, it's not a problem by itself, but you can't build things with it (unless you are on a mountain or you don’t lit anything)...

How about packed ice? It's not transparent. A resource pack? I’d lose opaque ice blocks.
 
So I came with this idea: instead of disabling the random ticking of ice blocks (and losing some traps mechanics, see this introduction), I've created a new block called "Eternal Ice". It copies the original ice block with a few tweaks:
 
- It doesn’t melt, never;
- It doesn’t release water on harvest (it still needs silk touch, though);
- It can be dyed, and that’s nice ~~because I love colors and rainbows and all that is colored in general such as jeb_ sheeps and unicorns and…~~ _shut up!_
 
Of course these blocks aren’t free, and you will need some ice and some materials to craft them:

This pickaxe harvests eternal ice blocks directly when you break ice blocks with it and can harvest stained / basic eternal ice blocks.
Otherwise it acts like a diamond pickaxe.

**Note**: You can use any color of stained eternal ice, even basic eternal ice, but you can't color 8 blocks with the same dye (that would be stupid, isn't it?):

**Note**:  A crystal can be used 64 times (so you can infuse 8 * 64 = 512 ice blocks to make eternal ice blocks with 1 crystal) in the crafting grid, whereas making a frozen pickaxe uses 3 crystals and has a durability of 1561 vs 1536 with 3 crystals separately.
 
I made this mod to satisfy my needs, but there are possibly some adjustments to do, so please tell me anything that you could find wrong or misplaced within this mod; I’ll do my best to make it the most balanced I can.
